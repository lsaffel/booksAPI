# restAPI

Building a REST API with Node and Express

Run from a terminal window with:
node book-api.js

Then open the HTML page:
new-book.html

Enter a few books via that page with submit, then back,
then submit another book etc.

Display the list of books by opening the HTML page:
book-list.html

Once some books are entered, a book can be displayed by its ISBN number.
For example, if a book's ISBN number is 1258,
the book's data can be displayed at:
localhost:3000/book/1258
